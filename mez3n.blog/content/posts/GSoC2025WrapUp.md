# GSoC 2025 Final Report: Implementing POSIX Issue 8 Functions in RTEMS

## Project Summary

My Google Summer of Code 2025 project focused on enhancing RTEMS' POSIX compliance by implementing critical functions introduced in POSIX Issue 8. RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is a real-time operating system designed for embedded and mission-critical applications, including space exploration and aerospace systems.

The goal of this project was to analyze, implement, and thoroughly test missing POSIX Issue 8 APIs to bring RTEMS closer to full POSIX compliance, enabling better portability and functionality for real-time applications.

**Project Proposal:** [GSOC2025_MEZ3N_New APIs Added to POSIX Standard (Issue8)(#69)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n69h3cvYUvXeSV85Vdl_XBlhRKBoalrreGpRYpx99Tk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qwofntymv246)  
**GitLab Activity:** [My contribution history](https://gitlab.rtems.org/users/mez3n/activity)  
**Project Issue:** [rtems/programs/gsoc#69](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/programs/gsoc/-/issues/69)  
**Project Epic:** [rtems&24](https://gitlab.rtems.org/groups/rtems/-/epics/24)

## Work Completed

Throughout the summer, I successfully implemented and tested all 11 POSIX Issue 8 functions. The implementation process required several foundational steps before the actual function development could begin.

## Newlib Header Updates

Before implementing the functions in RTEMS, I first had to modify the Newlib C library headers to add proper function declarations and feature test macro guards for the new POSIX Issue 8 functions that I would be implementing. This foundational work was essential to ensure the functions would be properly exposed to applications.

**Newlib Header Patch:** [Add POSIX Issue 8 function declarations](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/newlib/2025/021926.html)

This patch added the necessary function prototypes and conditional compilation guards to headers like `pthread.h`, `semaphore.h`, `time.h`, and others, ensuring that the new functions would be available when applications compile with the appropriate feature test macros.

## Header Verification Tests

Before implementing the actual functions, I had to created OK tests to verify that all POSIX Issue 8 functions are properly declared in their respective header files.

**Header OK Tests:** [MR !497 - Add POSIX Issue 8 header verification](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/rtos/rtems/-/merge_requests/497)

Additionally, I updated the thread queue infrastructure to ease the integration of pthread clock functions:

**Thread Queue Updates:** [MR !618 - Update thread queues for clock function support](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/rtos/rtems/-/merge_requests/618)

These foundational changes streamlined the implementation of clock-based pthread functions by creating shared infrastructure, making the code more maintainable and reducing duplication.

## Summary of Implemented Functions

## Current State

I successfully completed all 11 planned functions, with all functions fully integrated and available in RTEMS. The project significantly improved RTEMS' POSIX Issue 8 compliance.

## Merge Status

While all functions have been implemented and tested, some merge requests are currently on hold. The mentors decided to delay merging certain functions until after the GSoC period to avoid requiring all RTEMS 7 developers to update their toolchains during the active development phase, which would create unnecessary complications and hassle for other contributors during the summer.

## Conclusion

This GSoC experience has been transformative in my understanding of real-time systems programming. Contributing to RTEMS, which powers spacecraft and critical embedded systems, was both challenging and rewarding.

**Key Achievements:**
- **11/11 functions implemented** - 100% project completion
- **Full POSIX Issue 8 compliance** for targeted functions

I want to thank my mentors and the entire RTEMS community for their guidance throughout this journey. The work significantly advances RTEMS' POSIX compliance and benefits the entire embedded systems community.

None of this would have been possible without the invaluable guidance I received throughout the coding period from my mentors Joel, Gedare, and the entire RTEMS community. Beyond the technical implementation, I learned many important lessons: from maintaining backup branches to safeguard work, to the value of thorough documentation and comprehensive testing, and most importantly, the role of curiosity and continuous learning in software engineering. These lessons will stay with me and prove invaluable in my future career.

I am deeply grateful to my mentors, the RTEMS community, and to Google for providing me with this transformative opportunity and experience. I plan to continue contributing to RTEMS beyond GSoC, maintaining the implemented code and supporting future POSIX enhancements.
