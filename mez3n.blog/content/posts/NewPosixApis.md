The POSIX Standard Issue 8, released in 2024, represents a significant milestone in operating system standardization, introducing essential APIs that enhance portability, functionality, and compliance across Unix-like systems. As part of my Google Summer of Code 2025 project with RTEMS.

## Project Overview: Bridging the POSIX Gap in RTEMS

RTEMS, known for its reliability in mission-critical applications in space exploration currently lacks support for several key APIs introduced in POSIX Issue 8. This project aims to analyze, implement, and thoroughly test these missing APIs.

## The Missing APIs: A Strategic Analysis

After conducting a comprehensive review of RTEMS's current POSIX compliance status, I've identified APIs falling into three distinct categories that require different implementation approaches:

### Category 1: Already in Newlib (Verification & Testing Required)

These APIs exist in the Newlib C library but need comprehensive testing and documentation:

#### **at_quick_exit()**
- **Purpose**: Register functions to be called during quick program termination
- **Header**: `<stdlib.h>`
- **Prototype**: `int at_quick_exit(void (*func)(void));`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented in Newlib, requires testing framework

#### **quick_exit()**
- **Purpose**: Terminate program quickly without full cleanup
- **Header**: `<stdlib.h>`  
- **Prototype**: `_Noreturn void quick_exit(int status);`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented in Newlib, requires testing framework

### Category 2: Core RTEMS Implementation Required

These APIs require implementation directly in RTEMS with full kernel support:

#### **pthread_mutex_clocklock()**
- **Purpose**: Lock mutex with absolute timeout using specified clock
- **Header**: `<pthread.h>`
- **Prototype**: `int pthread_mutex_clocklock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, clockid_t clockid, const struct timespec *abstime);`
- **Challenge**: Integration with RTEMS thread queue infrastructure and multiple clock sources
- **Implementation Focus**: Thread queue timeout handling, clock source abstraction

#### **pthread_cond_clockwait()**
- **Purpose**: Wait on condition variable with clock-specific timeout
- **Header**: `<pthread.h>`
- **Prototype**: `int pthread_cond_clockwait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex, clockid_t clockid, const struct timespec *abstime);`
- **Challenge**: Atomic mutex unlock/wait operations with clock integration

#### **pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock() / pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock()**
- **Purpose**: Read/write lock acquisition with clock-specific timeouts
- **Headers**: `<pthread.h>`
- **Prototypes**: 
  ```c
  int pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock, clockid_t clockid, const struct timespec *abstime);
  int pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock, clockid_t clockid, const struct timespec *abstime);
  ```
- **Challenge**: Reader-writer semantics with priority protocols and timeout management

#### **sem_clockwait()**
- **Purpose**: Semaphore wait with clock-specific timeout
- **Header**: `<semaphore.h>`
- **Prototype**: `int sem_clockwait(sem_t *sem, clockid_t clockid, const struct timespec *abstime);`
- **Challenge**: Integration with RTEMS semaphore implementation

#### **timespec_get()**
- **Purpose**: Get current time with nanosecond precision
- **Header**: `<time.h>`
- **Prototype**: `int timespec_get(struct timespec *ts, int base);`
- **Implementation**: Support for TIME_UTC base with potential for future extensions

#### **posix_getdents()**
- **Purpose**: Get directory entries in a portable format
- **Header**: `<dirent.h>`
- **Prototype**: `ssize_t posix_getdents(int fd, void *buf, size_t nbytes, int *basep);`
- **Challenge**: Integration with RTEMS filesystem layer

#### **dladdr()**
- **Purpose**: Translate address to symbolic information
- **Header**: `<dlfcn.h>`
- **Prototype**: `int dladdr(const void *addr, Dl_info *info);`
- **Challenge**: Symbol table management and debug information handling

### Category 3: FreeBSD Integration (libbsd)

#### **ppoll()**
- **Purpose**: Wait for file descriptor events with signal masking and timeout
- **Header**: `<poll.h>`
- **Prototype**: `int ppoll(struct pollfd fds[], nfds_t nfds, const struct timespec *timeout, const sigset_t *sigmask);`
- **Status**: Available in FreeBSD, requires adaptation to RTEMS libbsd

## Technical Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: (June 2 - July 18)

**Verification of Existing APIs**:
I've already confirmed that `at_quick_exit()` and `quick_exit()` exist in Newlib by successfully patching the RTEMS Source Builder and adding debug output to these functions. The test produced expected results, confirming the APIs are functional but lack comprehensive test coverage.

**Test-Driven Development Strategy**:
Following TDD principles, I'm developing comprehensive test suites for all target APIs.

**Clock-Based Synchronization APIs**:
The pthread clock variants represent the most technically challenging implementations, requiring deep integration with RTEMS's thread queue infrastructure. Key considerations include:

**Pthread Clock Function Implementation**:
The four pthread clock variants (`pthread_mutex_clocklock()`, `pthread_cond_clockwait()`, `pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock()`, and `pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock()`) introduce clock-specific timeout capabilities to RTEMS's synchronization primitives. Unlike their traditional timed counterparts that rely solely on `CLOCK_REALTIME`, these functions allow developers to specify either `CLOCK_REALTIME` or `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` as the timeout reference.

**Technical Implementation Challenges**:
- **Clock Source Abstraction**: Implementing unified timeout handling that seamlessly supports both `CLOCK_REALTIME` and `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` within RTEMS's existing infrastructure
- **Thread Queue Integration**: Extending current timeout mechanisms to accommodate clock-specific behavior while maintaining performance and determinism
- **Synchronization Semantics**: Ensuring atomic operations for condition variables (mutex unlock/wait) and proper reader-writer lock behavior with clock-based timeouts
- **Priority Protocol Compliance**: Maintaining compatibility with priority inheritance and ceiling protocols across all clock-based synchronization operations

The implementation will build upon RTEMS's proven thread queue timeout architecture while introducing the flexibility of multiple clock sources for enhanced real-time precision.

### Phase 2:  (July 18 - August 25)

**File System Integration**:
`posix_getdents()` requires careful integration with RTEMS's filesystem layer, ensuring compatibility across different filesystem types while maintaining POSIX semantics.

**ppoll() FreeBSD Adaptation**:
`ppoll()` implementation involves adapting existing FreeBSD code to work within RTEMS's libbsd framework, ensuring proper signal masking integration and timeout handling while maintaining compatibility with RTEMS's event-driven architecture.

**Semaphore Clock Integration**:
`sem_clockwait()` requires extending RTEMS's semaphore implementation to support multiple clock sources, integrating with the existing semaphore blocking mechanisms while adding clock-specific timeout behavior.

**High-Precision Time Retrieval**:
`timespec_get()` implementation focuses on providing nanosecond-precision time access with support for TIME_UTC base, potentially extensible to support additional time bases in future POSIX revisions.

**Dynamic Symbol Resolution**:
`dladdr()` requires integration with RTEMS's dynamic loading infrastructure, implementing symbol table traversal and address-to-symbol mapping functionality while handling both static and dynamically loaded code segments.

## Development Environment and Methodology

### Tools and Infrastructure
- **Development Environment**: ✅ RTEMS development environment configured
- **Version Control**: ✅ Dedicated GitHub repository established
- **Testing Platform**: QEMU-based simulation with Xilinx Zynq A9

## Real-World Impact

These API implementations will provide significant benefits:

**Enhanced Application Portability**: Modern applications expecting POSIX Issue 8 APIs will run natively on RTEMS without modification.

**Improved Time Handling**: Clock-specific synchronization APIs enable more precise timing control, crucial for real-time applications.

**Better Resource Management**: Enhanced file descriptor and directory operations improve system efficiency.

**Standards Compliance**: Maintaining RTEMS's reputation as a standards-compliant RTOS for mission-critical applications.
